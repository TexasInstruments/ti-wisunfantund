`ti-behavior-immediate-changes` defines an intermediateChanges boolean attribute that can be used to control
if immediate changes to a widget are refected in the value attribute, or if the value attribute is only updated
after changes have been committed by user action.

Example:

    behaviors: [TiBehaviorImmediateChanges]

@group Ti Elements
@polymerBehavior TiBehaviorImmediateChanges
@homepage ../../../ti-guicomposer-helpindex/demo.html
